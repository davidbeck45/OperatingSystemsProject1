The program is invoked as follows:
  ./reverse input_file
  ./reverse input_file output_file
  Handles various cases, such as reading from an input file, writing to an output file, or printing to the screen.
  Focuses on C programming mindset and encourages starting early.
  Assumptions:
  
  No assumptions about line or file length.

Errors Handling:

  Handles cases like same input and output file, invalid files, system call failures, and incorrect number of program arguments.
  Useful Routines:
  
  Recommends using routines like fopen(), getline(), fclose(), malloc(), free(), fprintf(), and exit().

General Requirements:

Zero exit status if no errors.
Written in C, follows Linux Kernel coding style.
No execution of external programs or network resource usage.
Proper memory management and file closure are mandatory.
